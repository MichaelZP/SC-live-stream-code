# SC-live-stream-code
code from my SuperCollider live streams on twitch.tv

SuperCollider is a platform for audio synthesis and algorithmic
composition, used by musicians, artists, and researchers working
with sound. It is free and open source software available for
Windows, macOS, and Linux.

I sometimes live stream SC programming sessions to twitch:
twitch.tv/elifieldsteel

And I archive the stream videos to my YouTube channel:

This repository contains code shown/created during live streams,
and is provided for the convenience of not having to copy
code from an online video.
